Explanation:
This is a web-based career simulator meant to show users what real world jobs are like. Users can choose between being a restaurant manager (who balances money, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness) or a truck delivery manager (who oversees truck routes to make deliveries). Both simulations require similar skills to that of the real job, such as decision-making and maintaining efficiency. 
This project was made with Python (Flask) and HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
